## This exploratory analysis is to answer the question, "Which city
## has seen greater changes to motor vehicle emissions over 
## time (from 1999â€“2008) - Baltimore City (fips=="24510") or
## LA County, CA (fips=="06037")?" 
## The plot created by this script shows the total PM2.5 
## emissions in Baltimore City & LA County from motor vehicle sources
## for years 1998,2002,2005,&2008.
## *Note: LA County totals have been scaled to 1=10 for plot
## readability.*
## The results show emissions remaining steady or decreasing for
## Baltimore City, while LA County totals increased until the
## period between 2005 & 2008. Baltimore City has seen the 
## greatest overall change from 1998 to 2008.
