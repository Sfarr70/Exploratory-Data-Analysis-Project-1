## This exploratory analysis is to answer the question, "How have
## emissions from motor vehicle sources changed 
## from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City, MD (fips=="24510")?" 
## The plot created by this script shows the total PM2.5 
## emissions in Baltimore City from motor vehicle sources for the
## years 1998,2002,2005,&2008.
## The results indicate there was a drastic decrease between 1999
## & 2002; very little change between 2002 & 2005; and another drastic
## decrease between 2005 & 2008. Since there is no data for years
## other than those plotted, it's impossible to tell if those changes
## were sudden or if they were more gradual.


## load libraries

## Read data

NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

## Write data to txt files. This allows us to read subsets of the
## dataframe into R - saving processing time and space.

## Clean environment. Keep SCC data. It is needed to determine the SCC 
## number for coal combustion related sources
rm(NEI)

## Review SCC data to see what variable(s) indicate motor vehicle
## sources of PM2.5

## Data.Category==onroad is the only one that has data for motor vehicles.
## Motor vehicle sources are also the only data for onroad.
## Use that to get an index of SCC numbers

## Use sccindex to create character vector of SCC numbers

sccnums <- as.character(SCC[sccindex,1])

## Read SCC, Emissions, and year columns from NEI.txt.

subdb <- fread("NEI.txt",header=TRUE,select = c(1,2,4,6))


## Filter SCC numbers that match those in sccnums vector

## Filter for Baltimore City (fips=="24510")
