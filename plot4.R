## This exploratory analysis is to answer the question, "Across the
## how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed 
## from 1999â€“2008?" 
## The plot created by this script shows the total PM2.5 
## emissions in the US by coal combustion related sources for the
## years 1998,2002,2005,&2008.
## The results indicate there was very little change from
## 1998-2005 and a drastic decrease between 2005 & 2008. Since
## there is no data for '06-'07, it's impossible to tell if that
## was a sudden change or a gradual change.
